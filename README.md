# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
  - To establish a base with HTLM, CSS, Git, and JavaScript to build upon over the duration of the bootcamp.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
  - As an introduction to what I will learn throughout the course.
- What problem does it solve?
  - It doesn't completely solve my ignorance with this field, but it has certainly helped start the process. 
- What did you learn?
  - I started learning the basics to build this simple webpage, while applying HTLM, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage

This is usable in many ways as a study platform or a living document of my notes throughout the course. I look forward to adding to it as the course goes on. Each section will grow and contain more notes on the topics listed. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
